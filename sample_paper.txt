This paper explores the use of artificial intelligence for academic document summarization.
The proposed approach focuses on reducing processing time by compressing large documents.
Experimental results indicate that compressed context improves efficiency while preserving key technical details.
The system demonstrates the benefits of retrieval-based summarization over full-document processing.
